HI! I'm Shihan Fu (‰ªòËØóÂØí) üëãüèª , a Ph.D. student at Northeastern University. Before that, I got my MPhil at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology majoring in computational media and arts (CMA), during which I was advised by [Prof. Mingming Fan](https://www.mingmingfan.com/) as a group member of [APEX Lab](https://www.mingmingfan.com/lab/).

My current academic supervisor is [Prof. Dakuo Wang](https://www.dakuowang.com/).


My research interests include Human-Computer Interaction, Accessibility, Human-AI collaboration, Virtual Reality, and Social Computing.
We are working to make computing more accessible and usable to everyone.

You can find my CV here: [Shihan's CV](assets/ShihanFu's%20CV.pdf).
