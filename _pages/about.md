HI! I'm Shihan, an MPhil student majoring in computational media and arts (CMA) from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My research interests include Human-Computer Interaction, Accessibility, Human-AI collaboration, Virtual Reality, and Social Computing.

My current academic supervisor is Prof.Mingming Fan, I'm also a group member in [APEX Lab](https://www.mingmingfan.com/lab/) at HKUST. We are working to make computing more accessible and usable to everyone.

You can find my CV here: [Shihan's Curriculum Vitae](assets/ShihanFu's%20CV.pdf).
